<blockquote>In this project we had to replicate the old game using only SDL. SDL gave us the posibility to render images and to had input and with those two aspects we had to program everything else like collisions or the creation of the block map from a data file structure. One of the most complexes things was to be very careful with when we could erase objects when we changed from one state to another across our GameStateMachine. Another complex thing was to program de bounce of the ball, because it dependeds of things such as its direction, the paddle direction, the place where the collision takes place...</blockquote>
