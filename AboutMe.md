					<h3>First Steps in Gaming</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The first time I knew about what videogames were like was when I was 4 years old and my older cousin lend me his NintendoDS with Pokemon Diamond on. I can't describe what I felt but I still can remember that it meant it all to me, my parents so how bad I wanted to play with my cousin's Nintendo and they decided to buy me one.</p>

					<h3>Turning Point</h3>
				</header>
				<p>When I was in high school my grandfather passed away and at that time I didn't know how to handle it and videogames helped me escape reality while I was playing. That's where I discovered the game that changed it all, Firewatch. This game made me feel a lot of things but above all I felt identified with the main character, the way he tries to avoid his reality by having a job as a forest guard and the way the game ends helped me through my journey.<br>
				At the time I ended I decided that I wanted to be like those people that made that game and that I wanted to help people from all around the world with my work and passion and my goal since then is still the same. </p>

					<h3>Leaving home</h3>
				</header>
				<p>At the time I finished high school I already knew where I wanted to study, in Universidad Complutense de Madrid, and with the constant support of my parents I had the possibility of goind to the capital in order to follow my dreams.<br>
				Here I've meet a lot of new friends and certain people that have truly changed my life like my girlfriend Patricia which has helped me a lot in my university time and has helped me make other dreams come true like going to watch some League of Legends e-sports abroad.</p>
