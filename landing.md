					<h3>Cuando la locura llega</h3>
				</header>
				<p>"Cuando la locura llega" is a blender animation I did as a final job for my animation subject and it was inspired by Far Cry 3 villain Vaas Montenegro. Here I tried to recreate his characteristics as a psychopath and exagerate them as we hadn't had time to use other kind of models that could allow us to have face animations. </p>

					<h3>Plobo</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Plobo was a game made in Phaser and served as my introduction to JavaScript. In Plobo, we attempted to narrate a challenging story, partially based on a story from one of the developers' friends, in a satirical manner.</p>
